    QuranKu is an Android application designed to help you learn to recite the Qur’an with proper tajweed. Using voice recognition technology, this app can detect recitation errors and provide instant feedback. QuranKu applies MFCC and SVM methods to analyze the user’s voice.\n\n
    This application was developed as part of a thesis project at the Institute of Technology PLN (IT-PLN), with the hope of serving as both a learning tool and a form of digital charity.\n\n
        Let’s improve your Qur’an recitation together with QuranKu!
